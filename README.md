# Simple App

To kick the tires of all those fancy new PaaS (and the old ones too).

Once deployed, the interesting urls are

- `/health_check`
- `/internals`
- `/commands`
- `/sleep/n` where n is an int or a float. Executes `sleep n`

## LogStash

Customize where things are logged to with `LOGSTASH` (IP or domain) and `LOGSTASH_PORT`.
